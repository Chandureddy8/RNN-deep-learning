Do you know how Google’s autocompleting feature predicts the rest of the words a user is typing, or how Google Assistant works? This happens with the help of a special kind of neural network called a Recurrent Neural Network. And this is how Google’s autocompleting feature works - A collection of large volumes of most frequently occurring consecutive words is stored in a database, and this data is fed to a recurrent neural network. The network analyzes the data by finding the sequence of words occurring frequently and builds a model to predict the next word in the sentence. 

For example, if you search for “What’s the best food to eat in Las ______,” Google autocompletes to results in Vegas
